                            version 3.3 pre

                       http://korganizer.kde.org

Next release: KDEPIM-3.3 (something like May 2004)

QUICK NOTES ON WHAT'S NEW IN THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS:

* Official 3.2 release (January 2004)

  - New Features:
    - Support for multiple calendars and todo lists. Korganizer can now
      transparently merge calendar data from different files or other calendar
      data sources for example calendars on the web. They can conveniently
      activated, deactivated, added and removed from the graphical user
      interface.
    - Kontact integration. KOrganizer now is fully integrated with Kontact, the
      complete KDE personal information management application. Within Kontact
      some additional features are available like conversion of mails to events
      or todos by drag and drop.
    - New storage model: The notion of an active calendar was replaced by a
      persistant calendar. The user doesn't have to take care of loading or
      saving the calendar. Changes are immediately saved to disk. If the
      calendar is changed externally it is automatically loaded and updated in
      the view. A locking mechansim handles concurrent access to the calendar.
    - Undo and Redo. KOrganizer now supports unlimited undo and redo.
    - Todo integration with agenda view. Todos are shown in the week and day
      views. Todos can be converted to events by dragging from the todo list and
      dropping on the agenda view.
    - Attachements for events and todos. References to web pages, local files or
      mails can be attached to events and todos. The attached data can easily be
      accessed by a single click from the event and todo views as well as the
      summary view or the editors.
    - Quick todo entry. A special input field allows to quickly create a todo
      without needing to open an editor. This is especially handy for creating
      multiple todos in a row.
    - Quick event entry. There are several new ways to create events from the
      agenda view: Per type-ahead events can be created by selecting a time
      range and then simply starting to type. An editor will be opened and the
      type text will be go into the summary input line. Optionally the event
      editor can be opened when the time selection is finished and in addition
      to the usual menu and toolbar entries there are key bindings and a context
      menu to start the editor dialog.
    - Plugin for Jewish calendar dates. When enabled this plugin shows the
      Jewish calendar dates for each day in the calendar view.
    - Improved print support. The print dialogs were rewritten. Printing now
      supports colors and overlapping events.

  - User interface polishing. The visual appearance of KOrganizer was improved
    by a rewrite of the agenda view rendering and other enhancements like the
    text fade-out when there isn't enough space to display the full text or the
    graphical display of the completion state of todos. Many usability
    improvements were incoreporated, like support for moving multi-day events in
    the agenda view by dragging with the mouse, more complete and consistent key
    bindings and context menus, better menu structure and more concise texts.
    Some of these improvements were stimulated by external usability studies.

  - Bug fixes. Countless bug fixes went into this version, one of them being a
    fix for the session management which closes the, according to Bugzilla, most
    hated bug of KOrganizer 3.1.

  - Better performance. The speed of calendar loading and saving was
    significantly improved and memory consumption of calendars was decreased.

  - Architecture and framework:
     - KOrganizer makes use of the KDE resource framework KResources which
       provides uniform management of calendar, addressbook and similar
       resources including generic ways to handle locking and change
       notification. This also provides a plugin interface for adding resources
       which makes it possible to easily extend Korganizer for example to access
       groupware servers or other ways to store calendar data. 
     - KOrganizer configuration is now based on KConfig XT. That means that
       there is an abstract XML based description of the configuration which is
       used for generating the needed code to access the configuration data and
       serves as base for external configuration tools.
     - Simplification of alarm daemon. KOrganizer doesn't use kalarmd anymore,
       it only needs the korgac daemon which also rpovides the system tray icon
       for being able to notify about alarms. Run control of the alarm daemon
       also was simplified, it's now all done by the context menu of the system
       tray icon and doesn't need the control center anymore.
     - The configuration dialog is now based on kcontrol modules. This is a
       prerequisite for integrating the configuration within Kontact.
     - KMail now directly supports transfer of invitations and other calendar
       attachments to KOrganizer. This supercedes the korganizerIn script
       solution.
     - Accessing the calendar from the command line is now exclusively handled
       by a native command line application, konsolekalendar.

INTRODUCTION:

KOrganizer aims to be a complete program for organizing your
appointments, contacts, projects, etc.  It is in the same spirit as
similar programs like the now ubiquitous Microsoft Outlook, Starfish
Internet Sidekick, Time & Chaos, etc. (all for the Microsoft Windows
platform, of course.)  Best of all, It reads and writes the vCalendar
file format NATIVELY (please see http://www.imc.org/pdi for more
information), which is now an industry-wide personal data interchange
format.  Because of this, you should be able to move from other modern
PIMs to KOrganizer with relative ease.  Current users of the popular
program ical should definitely take a look at KOrganizer and compare
features.

KOrganizer also offers full synchronization with your Palm Pilot, if you
have kpilot installed.

To install KOrganizer, please read the file INSTALL.  The process is
analogous to other KDE applications.

Documentation is available online from the Help->Contents menu option.
While it is not complete and has not been updated in several months,
it is at least partially helpful.  Anyone wishing to help on completing
or enhancing the documentation should contact me directly at the email
address given at the end of this document.

BUGS:

Bugs can be reported to the KDE bug tracking system (http://bugs.kde.org).
There you can also get information about the status of older bugs.
KOrganizer, as most other KDE 2 programs, offers a menu item "Report Bug"
in the Help menu for convenient reporting of bugs or feature requests.

NEWS and TODO:

Have a look at the KOrganizer homepage (http://korganizer.kde.org).
There you find news and a todo list for future KOrganizer development (of
course generated with KOrganizer itself).

CONTACT INFORMATION:

We want your suggestions and comments!

Cornelius Schumacher (schumacher@kde.org)

I always welcome contributions and new members for the team.
