QUICK NOTES ON WHAT'S NEW IN THIS RELEASE:

* Official 1.0 release

INTRODUCTION:

KOrganizer aims to be a complete program for organizing your
appointments, contacts, projects, etc.  It is in the same spirit as
similar programs like the now ubiquitous Microsoft Outlook, Starfish
Internet Sidekick, Time & Chaos, etc. (all for the Microsoft Windows
platform, of course.)  Best of all, It reads and writes the vCalendar
file format NATIVELY (please see http://www.imc.org/pdi for more
information), which is now an industry-wide personal data interchange
format.  Because of this, you should be able to move from other modern
PIMs to KOrganizer with relative ease.  Current users of the popular
program ical should definitely take a look at KOrganizer and compare
features.

KOrganizer also offers full synchronization with your Palm Pilot, if you
have kpilot installed.

To install KOrganizer, please read the file INSTALL.  The process is
analogous to other KDE applications.

Documentation is available online from the Help->Contents menu option.
While it is not complete and has not been updated in several months,
it is at least partially helpful.  Anyone wishing to help on completing
or enhancing the documentation should contact me directly at the email
address given at the end of this document.

BUGS: Known bugs are listed in the file BUGS.  I'll add and remove
bug reports to this file as they come in or get squashed.
