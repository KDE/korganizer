/**
 *  Replacement for kdpdatebuton.cpp that used 42 widgets for the day
 *  matrix to be displayed. Cornelius thought this was a waste of memory
 *  and a lot of overhead. In addition the selection was not very intuitive
 *  so I decided to rewrite it using a QFrame that draws the labels and
 *  allows for dragging selection while maintaining nearly full compatibility
 *  in behavior with its predecessor.
 *
 *  The following functionality has been changed:
 *
 *  o when shifting events in the agenda view from one day to another
 *    the day matrix is updated now
 *
 *  o dragging an event to the matrix will MOVE not COPY the event to the
 *    new date.
 *
 *  o no support for Ctrl+click to create groups of dates
 *    (This has not really been supported in the predecessor.
 *    It was not very intuitive nor was it user friendly.)
 *    This feature has been replaced with dragging a selection on the matrix.
 *    The matrix will automatically choose the appropriate selection (e.g. you
 *    are not any longer able to select two distinct groups of date selections
 *    as in the old class)
 *
 *  o now that you can select more than a week it can happen that not all
 *    selected days are displayed in the matrix. However this is preferred
 *    to the alternative which would mean to adjust the selection and leave
 *    some days undisplayed while scrolling through the months
