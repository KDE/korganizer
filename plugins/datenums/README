Jewish calendar plugin for KOrganizer, by Jonathan Singer <jsinger@leeta.net>

Note that it only applies to modern (Gregorian) dates, as KDE/Qt does not 
support Julian dates. See my KLuach application <http://www.leeta.net/kluach> if 
you want to look up historical dates.

TRANSLATORS! The weird-looking text strings are the names of Jewish months. They 
aren't translateable (although European or Near Eastern languages may spell them 
differently) and should usually just be changed into local characters with the 
same sound. "I" and "II" are Roman numerals. Please write me if you have any 
questions.I'm working on adding holiday, parsha and omer support.
