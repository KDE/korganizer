    Tables for each of the year types. XX indicates that it is a Holiday, and a
    special parsha is read that week. For some year types among the 14, Israel
    is different from the diaspora.

    The names indicate the day of the week on which Rosh Hashanah fell, whether
    it is a short/normal/long year (kvia=0,1,2), and whether it is a leap year.
    As said earlier, some year types also have an _Israel version.

    The numbers are indices in the list above for a given week.
    Numbers > 100 indicate a double parsha, e.g. 150 means read both table
    entries 150 - 100 = 50 and 150 - 99 = 51.

    These tables were stolen (with some massaging) from the Gnu code.
