Jewish calendar plugin for KOrganizer, by Jonathan Singer <jsinger@leeta.net>

Note that it only applies to modern (Gregorian) dates, as KDE/Qt does not
support Julian dates. See my KLuach application <http://www.leeta.net/kluach>
if you want to look up historical dates.

TRANSLATORS! The weird-looking text strings are the names of Jewish months,
holidays and whatnot. They aren't translateable (although European or Near
Eastern languages may spell them differently) and should usually just be changed
into local characters with the same sound. "I" and "II" are Roman numerals.
