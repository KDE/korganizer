/**
 *  Replacement for kdpdatebuton.cpp that used 42 widgets for the day matrix to be displayed.
 *  Cornelius thought this was a waste of memory and a lot of overhead.
 *  In addition the selection was not very intuitive so I decided to rewrite it using a QFrame
 *  that draws the labels and allows for dragging selection while maintaining nearly full
 *  compatibility in behavior with its predecessor.
 *
 *  The following functionality has been changed:
 *
 *  o when shifting events in the agenda view from one day to another the day matrix is updated now
 *  o dragging an event to the matrix will MOVE not COPY the event to the new date.
 *  o no support for Ctrl+click to create groups of dates
 *    (This has not really been supported in the predecessor. It was not very intuitive nor was it
 *     user friendly.)
 *    This feature has been replaced with dragging a selection on the matrix. The matrix will
 *    automatically choose the appropriate selection (e.g. you are not any longer able to select
 *    two distinct groups of date selections as in the old class)
 *  o now that you can select more then a week it can happen that not all selected days are
 *    displayed in the matrix. However this is preferred to the alternative which would mean to
 *    adjust the selection and leave some days undisplayed while scrolling through the months
